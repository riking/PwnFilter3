# PwnFilter rules.txt - Define Regular Expression Rules
# SAMPLE RULES http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/pwnfilter/
# NOTE: ALL MATCHES AUTOMATICALLY IGNORE CASE
#
# Rules are applied in the order they are listed in this file.  Using the "then abort" action
# will stop further rule processing.  So, if you want a rule to take priority over the others,
# list it first in this file.  If you want a rule to stop further processing, use "then abort"
# as an action to that rule.
#
# Each rule must have one 'match' statement and at least one 'then' statement, everything else is optional.
#
# match <regular expression>
#
# events <chat,command,sign> (This format only applies to events listed. default = all events)
# OR
# events not <chat,command,sign> (This format applies to all events -except- those listed)
#
# ignore|require <user|permission|string|command> <string> *(optional)
# then <replace|rewrite|warn|log|deny|debug|kick|kill|burn|command|console|abort> <string>
# For more details visit http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/pwnfilter/
# In "then command" statements, you can use &world, &player, &string, or &rawstring

# EXAMPLES
